## 16-Bit Tavern Game Board

**Objective:** Transform a provided blueprint into a high-fidelity, top-down pixel art scene. The input image geometry must be followed exactly.

### Layout Mapping

* **Red Rectangle (Top):** Opponent’s Hand Zone. Texture as a red velvet mat or dark wooden rack filling the entire area.
* **Green Rectangle (Bottom):** Player’s Hand Zone. Texture as a hunter-green felt mat or wooden rack filling the entire area.
* **Black/Dark Rectangle (Center):** Battlefield. Texture as a dark green or grey felt mat.
* **Brown Side Areas:** Background tavern table. Texture as worn wood with organic clutter (e.g., coins, spilled mugs, scratches).

### Technical Constraints

* **Perspective:** Strict top-down, orthographic.
* **Adherence:** The colored zones are not "areas for objects"—they **are** the objects. Texture the entire footprint of each rectangle.
* **Lighting:** Warm tavern-style illumination.
